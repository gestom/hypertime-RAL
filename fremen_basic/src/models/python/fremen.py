basic FreMEn to find most influential periodicity, call
chosen_period(T, time_frame_sums, time_frame_freqs, longest, shortest, W, ES):
it returns the most influential period in the timeseries, where timeseries are
    the residues between reality and model
where
input: T numpy array Nx1, time positions of measured values
       time_frame_sums numpy array shape_of_grid[0]x1, sum of measures
                                                        over every
                                                        timeframe
       time_frame_freqs numpy array shape_of_grid[0]x1, sum of
                                                        frequencies(stat)

                                                        timeframe
       W numpy array Lx1, sequence of reasonable frequencies
       ES float64, squared sum of squares of residues from the last
                   iteration
and
output: P float64, length of the most influential frequency in default
        units
        W numpy array Lx1, sequence of reasonable frequencies without
                           the chosen one
        ES_new float64, squared sum of squares of residues from
                        this iteration
        dES float64, difference between last and new error

for the creation of a list of reasonable frequencies call
build_frequencies(longest, shortest):
where
longest - float, legth of the longest wanted period in default units,
        - usualy four weeks
shortest - float, legth of the shortest wanted period in default units,
         - usualy one hour.
It is necessary to understand what periodicities you are looking for (or what
    periodicities you think are the most influential)
